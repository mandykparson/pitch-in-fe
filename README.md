## Introduction
Pitch In was inspired by my desire to share a budget with my friends; think Venmo but with more people. Upon logging in users can connect to a bank, create a "pitch" and request funds from their pitches. This app is currently just a proof of concept but I do hope to continue working on it after I'm finished graduating from Flatiron School (Aug 2021). 

## Technologies
* :electron: React TypeScript
* 🟩  Node.js
* 🐘  PostgreSQL
* ⚙️  Knex
* 🔐  JWT
